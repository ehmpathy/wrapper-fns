  const response = await withRetry(
    withTimeout(async () => thread.run(fullPrompt, { outputSchema }), {
      threshold: { seconds: 60 },
    }),
  )();


this should have thrown a compiletime type error, due to withRetry's NEED for context with log trail.


also, instead of VisualogicContext, use ContextLogTrail from 'simple-log-methods' instead

and use ProcedureInput, ProcedureOutput, ProcedureContext from 'as-procedure' instead of the visualogic package
